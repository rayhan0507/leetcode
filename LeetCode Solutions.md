## Directory Structure

The solutions are organized in a hierarchical manner:

```
leetcode/
├── easy/
│   ├── hash-table/
│   │   ├── Problem-Name-One/
│   │   │   └── solution.py
│   │   ├── Problem-Name-Two/
│   │   │   └── solution.py
│   │   └── ...
│   └── array/
│       └── ...
├── medium/
│   └── ...
└── hard/
    └── ...
```

Each problem has its own directory, named after the problem title, and contains the solution file (e.g., `solution.py` for Python, `solution.js` for JavaScript, etc.).

## Problem Categories

Problems are categorized by their difficulty level as defined by LeetCode:

- **Easy**: Fundamental problems that introduce basic concepts.
- **Medium**: Problems requiring a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- **Hard**: Challenging problems that often combine multiple concepts or require advanced techniques.

Within each difficulty level, problems are further organized by common algorithmic topics (e.g., Hash Table, Array, Dynamic Programming, etc.).

## How to Use

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.x (or other language runtimes depending on the solution)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rayhan0507/leetcode.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd leetcode
   ```
3. To view a specific solution, navigate to its directory. For example, to see the `Two Sum` solution:
   ```bash
   cd easy/hash-table/twosum
   ```
4. Run the solution (example for Python):
   ```bash
   python3 twosum.py
   ```
